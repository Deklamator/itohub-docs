# Managing a Deal

After the seller approves your request, a "deal room" is created. This is your personal control center for this specific transaction. Only the buyer and seller have access to this screen.

### Key Elements of the Deal Screen

1.  **Visual Status**: At the top of the screen, you will see a status tree (`StatusTree`) that visually displays the current stage of the deal and the steps already completed. The status automatically updates every 10-20 seconds.
2.  **Deal Chat**: Each deal includes a secure chat where you can communicate with the other party to clarify details.
3.  **Timer (for Ads)**: If the deal involves an ad placement, you will see a countdown timer to the post's publication time.

### Party Actions

Depending on your role (buyer or seller) and the current status of the deal, different buttons will be available to you to manage the process.

* **Seller Actions**:
    * Approve or reject the initial deal request.
    * Confirm the transfer of channel ownership.
    * Request a preview of the ad post from the buyer before publication.

* **Buyer Actions**:
    * Cancel the deal before payment.
    * Create and fund the escrow transaction on the TON blockchain by sending funds to the smart contract.
    * Confirm the receipt of channel ownership or the ad publication, which releases the funds to the seller.
