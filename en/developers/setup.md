# Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up your local environment to develop and run the `ito_web` project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
* Node.js (version 16.x or later)
* npm or yarn
* Git

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal and run the command to copy the project to your computer.
    ```bash
    git clone [Your repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ito_web
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm`. Run the command to install all required packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    After the dependencies are successfully installed, start the local development server.
    ```bash

    ```
    The application will then be available in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`. For full functionality testing, the application must be run within the Telegram Mini App environment.
