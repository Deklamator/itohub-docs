# Rewards System

Our platform encourages active users. In the "Rewards" section, you can complete simple tasks and earn points, which can be exchanged for bonuses in the future.

### What You Will See on the Screen

On the `/rewards` screen, the following information is available to you:

* **Your Balance and Level**: This shows the current number of points you have accumulated and your progress toward the next level.
* **Task List**: A list of available tasks to complete, indicating how many points you will receive for each one. An example of such a task might be "Connect a TON wallet for the first time."

### How It Works

The mechanism is very simple:
1.  You select a task from the list.
2.  You perform the specified action (e.g., connecting your wallet).
3.  The system automatically verifies the completion and credits the corresponding number of points to your balance.
