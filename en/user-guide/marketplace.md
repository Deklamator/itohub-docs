# Using the Marketplace (Top)

The "Top" section is a public marketplace where sellers post their public offers to sell channels or ad placements. It's a great place to discover new assets to purchase.

### Key Features

1.  **Browse Offers**: The screen displays a list of all public offers. You can scroll through them to find what you need.

2.  **Infinite Scroll**: The list of offers loads automatically as you scroll down, allowing you to conveniently browse a large number of listings without switching pages.

3.  **Sorting**: For your convenience, you can sort the offers by several key parameters:
    * By price
    * By the number of channel subscribers
    * By the seller's rating

4.  **Proceed to Purchase**: By clicking on any offer card, you will be taken to a screen with its detailed description. From there, you can initiate the purchase process by sending a request to the seller.
