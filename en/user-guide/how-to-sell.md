# How to Sell a Channel or Ad?

The asset selling process is intuitive and consists of several steps.

1.  **Proceed to Offer Creation**: On the main screen, press the "Sale" button. You will be redirected to the channel selection screen.

2.  **Select a Telegram Channel**: The system will display a list of your Telegram channels and groups where you are an administrator. Choose the asset you want to put up for sale.

3.  **Fill in the Details**: On the offer creation screen (`sales/upload-deal`), you will need to specify:
    * The title of your offer.
    * The price and currency (defaults to TON).
    * A detailed description for the buyer.
    * The offer type: **public** (visible to everyone in the marketplace) or **private** (accessible only by a code).

4.  **Receive the Offer Code**: After successful creation, you will be redirected to a success screen displaying the unique code for your offer. You can copy it and send it directly to a potential buyer.
