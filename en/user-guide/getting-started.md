# ðŸš€ Getting Started & Authentication

To use all features, the **ITOhub** platform must be launched inside Telegram.

1.  **Launching the App:** Open the application via the link in Telegram.
2.  **Automatic Authentication:** On the first launch, the app will automatically identify you based on your Telegram account data (`initData`). Our server verifies this data and grants you secure access.
3.  **Accepting the Rules:** Before you begin, you will be asked to read and accept the platform's rules. This is necessary to ensure fair and secure deals for all participants.
4.  **Connecting a Wallet:** You will need a TON wallet to conduct transactions. Click on the `Wallet` icon in the bottom navigation bar to connect your primary wallet via TON Connect.
