# How to Buy an Asset?

The process for buying an asset is designed to be simple and secure, whether you are responding to a private offer or choosing from the public marketplace.

### Buying a Private Offer

If a seller has provided you with a unique 6-digit code for a private offer, follow these steps:

1.  **Enter the Offer Code**: On the main screen, press the "Buy" button. You will be taken to a screen (`buy/code`) where you can enter the 6-digit code.

2.  **Review Offer Details**: After entering a valid code, the system will fetch the offer details and display them on the screen. You will see all the information about the channel or ad placement.

3.  **Provide Your Information (for Ad Postings)**: If you are buying an ad placement, you will need to provide additional details:
    * Select one of your pre-made ad creatives.
    * Set the desired publication date and time.
    * Specify the duration for how long the ad will be pinned or stay up.

4.  **Confirm and Send Request**: Double-check all the details to ensure they are correct. Once you are satisfied, confirm the transaction to send an offer request (`createOfferRequest`) to the seller.

5.  **Request Sent**: After successfully sending the request, you will see a confirmation screen. The seller will now be notified of your interest.

### Buying from the Marketplace

You can also browse public offers in the "Top" section, which acts as the marketplace. When you find an offer you like, clicking on it will take you to a similar details screen where you can proceed to create an offer request.
