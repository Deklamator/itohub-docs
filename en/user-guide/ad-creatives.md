# Managing Ad Creatives

The "Ad Creatives" section allows you to prepare and save materials for your future ad publications in advance. When you create a deal to sell advertising, you can quickly select one of these pre-made posts.

### Your Creatives List

The main screen of this section (`/ads/content`) displays a list of all the ad creatives you have ever created.

### Creating a New Creative

The process of creating a new creative is tightly integrated with a Telegram bot for maximum convenience.

1.  In the app, on the creatives list screen, you initiate the creation of a new post (e.g., via a "Create via Telegram" button).
2.  You will be redirected to a chat with a special bot.
3.  You send the bot all the content for your future ad post: text, images, videos, buttons, etc.
4.  After you have sent all materials to the bot, return to the Mini App. The interface will automatically update, and your new creative will appear in the list.

### Editing a Creative

Editing is split between the app and the bot:
* **In the app (`/ads/content/edit/:id`)**: You can only change the creative's "metadata," such as its internal name (title) or the button text.
* **Via the Telegram bot**: To change the main content (text or media files), you will need to interact with the bot again.
