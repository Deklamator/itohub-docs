# Security Analysis & Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the smart contract's logic, the following mandatory requirements for its security and reliability have been established.

### 1. Centralization and the Moderator Address

* **Problem**: The security of all funds on the contract depends on the security of a single keyâ€”the moderator's address, which is a single point of failure.
* **Requirement**: The moderator's address **MUST** be a multi-signature wallet (e.g., with a "2 of 3 signatures" scheme) to eliminate the risk associated with the loss or compromise of a single key.

### 2. Parameter Updatability

* **Problem**: Key parameters like the commission percentage and minimum fees are hard-coded into the contract's code.
* **Requirement**: These parameters should be stored in the contract's mutable data and be updatable via special `op_codes` available only to the moderator. This will allow for flexible adjustment of the project's economics without needing to redeploy the entire contract.

### 3. Lack of Timeouts

* **Problem**: In the current logic, a deal can remain "stuck" forever if one of the participants or the moderator becomes inactive.
* **Requirement**: A timeout mechanism must be implemented. For example, if the buyer does not confirm receipt of the asset within a certain time frame (e.g., 7 days), the seller should be able to initiate arbitration or receive the funds automatically.
