# 👋 Welcome to ITOhub

**ITOhub** is a TON-based Web3 platform for secure P2P deals inside Telegram.
We solve the core issue of lack of trust between channel admins, investors, and advertisers.

Problem

- Telegram channels and ads are traded “hand-to-hand,” often without guarantees.

- High fraud risk: deals rely on private agreements, payments are made upfront.

- No transparent system of reputation or deal history.

Solution

- Escrow via TON smart contracts — funds are reserved until deal completion.

- Mini App and bot — manage deals directly inside Telegram.

- Ratings and reviews — build trust based on transaction history.

Value

- Channel admins can sell channels and ad slots safely.

- Investors and buyers get transparency and guaranteed fund protection.

- The platform acts as a decentralized intermediary with a flat commission.
